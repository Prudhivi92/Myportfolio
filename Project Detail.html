            <h1>Revolutionizing & Redefining Experiences for agents</h1>
            <p>Agents face challenges accessing and comparing Medicare Advantage plans due to fragmented systems and
                manual processes. This inefficiency hampers their ability to deliver accurate, personalized
                recommendations, impacting both productivity and customer satisfaction.

                <p>
                    As part of our strategic initiative to enhance user engagement and satisfaction, we conducted
                    in-depth qualitative research with internal sales leadership and frontline agents. This research
                    focused on gaining a deeper understanding of targeted user segments that align with overarching
                    business goals.

            <p>
                After completing user interviews with agents, members and sales leaders we conducted an affinity mapping
                session where we documented each insight on sticky notes and grouped them into meaningful categories.
                This process helped us visualize recurring pain points specific to each group and align those insights
                with broader business goals in the health insurance space.
